# Improvments to DQNAlign

This code-base is built heavily upon the following repository https://github.com/syjqkrtk/DQNalign  

There are two versions of the codebase, one using Tensorflow 1.12 and one using PyTorch 1.13. The TensorFlow version is in the TF folder and the PyTorch version is in the Torch folder. 

It is highly reccomended to use the torch version as it is a newer library and is compatible with newer versions of Python

# Requirements
Works best on a linux environment with nucmer installed


Tensorflow version requirements
* Python == 3.5.4
* TensorFlow == 1.12

PyTorch version requirements  
* Python >= 3.10.5
* torch == 1.13
* torchvision == 0.14.0
* torchaudio == 0.13.0
